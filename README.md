# AI-Agent-CSM-UPRM-UND

This project is performed in collaboration with academics from the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez and the University of Notre Dame. The goal of this project is to develop an AI agent specialized in computational soft matter research.

This Streamlit app allows users to upload files, process them, run a LAMMPS simulation, and chat with an AI agent. The app utilizes various libraries and tools, including Streamlit, PyPDF2, docx, subprocess, OpenAI, Hugging Face, and more.

## Setup

Install the required packages: 
  - pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have the necessary APIs and keys for OpenAI

Make sure you have installed on your system the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) program

Running the App

Run the Streamlit app using: 
-   streamlit run main.py

Upload your files (PDF or DOCX).

Ask questions about the files or run a LAMMPS simulation.

## File Processing

1. PDF files are processed using PyPDF2 to extract text.
2. DOCX files are processed using the python-docx library to extract text.
3. Text Chunking
4. Text is split into chunks to improve processing efficiency. This is done using a custom CharacterTextSplitter class.
5. Vector Store Creation

## LAMMPS Simulations

You can request the AI agent to generate the LAMMPS input script and run the simmulation.
You can also paste your LAMMPS input script into the provided text area.
Click "Run Simulation" to execute the LAMMPS simulation using subprocess if you want to paste a script not generated by the AI agent.

## Chat with AI Agent

Ask questions about the uploaded files using the chat input.
The AI agent will provide responses based on the content of the files and previous interactions.

## Technologies Used

Python
Streamlit
OpenAI API
PyPDF2, docx (for file processing)

## Future Work

- Integration with vectorial database to store and enrich the RAG for the AI agent, and as a permanent storage.
- Develop Front end sign up, login and for streamlit app
