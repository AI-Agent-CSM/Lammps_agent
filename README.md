# AI-Agent-CSM-UPRM-UND
This Streamlit app allows users to upload files, process them, run a LAMMPS simulation, and chat with an AI agent. The app utilizes various libraries and tools, including Streamlit, PyPDF2, docx, subprocess, OpenAI, Hugging Face, and more.

Setup

Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you have the necessary APIs and keys for OpenAI

Make sure you have installed on your system the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS) program

Running the App

Run the Streamlit app using: streamlit run main.py

Upload your files (PDF or DOCX).

Ask questions about the files or run a LAMMPS simulation.

File Processing:

PDF files are processed using PyPDF2 to extract text.
DOCX files are processed using the python-docx library to extract text.
CSV files are supported.
Text Chunking
Text is split into chunks to improve processing efficiency. This is done using a custom CharacterTextSplitter class.
Vector Store Creation

LAMMPS Simulations:

You can request the AI agent to generate the LAMMPS input script and run the simmulation
You can also paste your LAMMPS input script into the provided text area.
Click "Run Simulation" to execute the LAMMPS simulation using subprocess if you want to paste a script not generated by the AI agent.
Chat with AI Agent

Ask questions about the uploaded files using the chat input.
The AI agent will provide responses based on the content of the files and previous interactions.

API:

The RESTful API is used to set and retrieve the OpenAI API key. The API endpoints are:
- POST /api/set_api_key: Set the OpenAI API key.
- GET /api/get_api_key: Retrieve the OpenAI API key.

Technologies Used:

Python
Streamlit
OpenAI API
Flask (for the RESTful API)
PyPDF2, docx (for file processing)

Future Work:

- Integration with vector database ChromaDB to store and enrich documents for the AI agent.
- Further develop RestfulAPI
